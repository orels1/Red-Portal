                    Red is an open source Discord bot powered by <a href="https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/" target="_blank"><b>discord.py</b></a>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    By default it includes fun general commands, audio playback, moderation features, trivia, slot machines and much more!

                    Cogs are what makes Red unique among other bots: they provide an almost endless amount of additional functionalities

                    <br/>
                    If you think of something you want Red to do there is probably a cog for it. Or at least one is in the making :)
